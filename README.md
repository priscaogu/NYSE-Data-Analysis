The dataset includes:
Financial fundamentals from SEC 10-K filings
Sector and industry classifications

## The purpose of this analysis was to:
Calculate descriptive statistics
Compare industries
Evaluate revenue distribution and variability
Analyze company-level financial stability
Communicate insights using structured data and visualization

## Dataset
Fundamentals.csv – Financial statement data
Securities.csv – Sector & industry classifications
Projectdata NYSE.csv – Cleaned dataset used for analysis

## Industry Comparison

Median Revenue	$10.26B	$10.79B
Standard Deviation	$28.27B	$12.52B
Range	$98.79B	$30.97B
Skewness	1.83	0.69

## Key Insights
Higher Average Revenue: Financials generate more revenue on average.
Higher Volatility: Financials show significantly greater variability due to large firms.
